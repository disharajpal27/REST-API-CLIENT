**DESCRIPTION OF TASK**

The task involved developing a Java application to consume a public REST API, specifically the OpenWeatherMap API, to fetch and display real-time weather data in a structured format. Using tools like IntelliJ IDEA, Maven, and JDK 17, the application demonstrated efficient handling of HTTP requests and JSON responses. The org.json library was employed to parse the JSON data, extracting information such as temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and wind speed. The Maven Compiler Plugin ensured compatibility with Java 17, while IntelliJ streamlined the development process. The API key from OpenWeatherMap was used to access weather data for specific cities. The program processes the API response, handles potential errors like invalid keys or network issues, and presents the weather details in a user-friendly console output. This project effectively showcases the integration of Java with RESTful APIs, leveraging modern tools and libraries to create a practical, real-world application.
